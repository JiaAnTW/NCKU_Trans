Using **React.js(Javascript ES6)** to build frontend, **PHP Laravel** to build backend, and **MySQL** to build database. Expected to be finished before March or April, 2019.

All of this website are still made by myself until this moment.  
However, I'm looking for frontend developers who can help me build this website. If you are passionate with this, please send me a message.

If you are in search of frontend works in this website, please check <code>resources/assets</code>.
